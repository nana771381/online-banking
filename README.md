OOP java project (taylors)

So this is the first ever individual project (a very simple one) that I made, for my uni's final exam.

There is 5 features in this system, that is to:

  1 -- Check Balance & Transaction Information
  
  2 -- Online Biling
  
  3 -- Balance Transfer
  
  4 -- Update Profile
  
  5 -- Logout
  
  
I assumed that I already have a default account with default username and password.

This is the default userID and password:

this.userId = 99887766;

this.password = "abc9876";
